# Ebook Sales Application

This repo contains 3. Code along,Hyf Node.js Module-week1-Homework.

In this application you'll be building an Ebook Sales Application. You'll make it possible to add new books to a list of books. You'll even learn how to put it out online, so you can get a URL that you can use to access your application anywhere.

In this app (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT3_zT97_1g) we will build a Node.js/Express app using the Stripe API to sell an ebook. We will be able to create a customer and charge their card. Everything is done in test mode. Once we build the app, we will deploy to Heroku
