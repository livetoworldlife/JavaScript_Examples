2
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:12,750
hi this is about stem from coding the

3
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:15,450
smart way comm and today in this video

4
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:19,320
tutorial I show you how to build a real

5
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,250
world web application by only using

6
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:25,619
Toyama script so we will not make use of

7
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:28,349
any other modern web frameworks like

8
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:32,610
angular react of UJS we will only use

9
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:36,120
poor JavaScript and by following this

10
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,940
tutorial you will be able to learn the

11
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:40,079
basics and build a real-world

12
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,190
application so stay tuned okay so let's

13
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:46,140
take a look at the sample application we

14
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,239
are going to build in this video

15
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:51,000
tutorial and you can see it here it's a

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,910
central issue tracker application where

17
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:57,120
you can put in some issues may be issues

18
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,620
with a regarding software product and

19
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:03,780
you can describe each issues by using

20
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:07,970
that input form here and we have input

21
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:10,290
controls available for putting in a

22
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:12,840
description text you can choose a

23
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,720
severity here from a list of low medium

24
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:19,549
and high and you can use the assigned to

25
00:01:19,549 --> 00:01:23,970
field of entering a name who is

26
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:25,770
responsible for maybe

27
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:28,409
solving that issue so let's try it out

28
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:32,840
maybe we will use as a description here

29
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:41,210
delete function in product it's not

30
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:45,329
working and we choose severity medium

31
00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:49,890
and enter my name assigned to and then I

32
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:52,020
can use the button head and you can see

33
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:56,460
it immediately here shown in the bottom

34
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:58,950
section of our application and you can

35
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:02,689
see all the issue is shown here with

36
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:06,000
status information so initially we are

37
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,258
setting each issue to status open and

38
00:02:09,258 --> 00:02:12,390
you can see we have two user actions

39
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:14,340
defined here by including two buttons

40
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:17,400
see the user can choose to click on

41
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,520
button close and by using the close

42
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:24,810
button you can see the issue is put to

43
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:26,360
use status closed

44
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:30,030
maybe we can enter a second one so let's

45
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:35,360
use second issue we put it too low and

46
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,400
[Music]

47
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,739
let's use another name here and you can

48
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:43,080
see it's automatically added here to the

49
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:47,130
list and now again it's put to open

50
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:49,770
because of the initial status and you

51
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:52,140
can see here is the severity here is the

52
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:56,190
assigned to name shown and the second

53
00:02:56,190 --> 00:03:01,260
user action we have included here is the

54
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:03,269
delete button the user can click on and

55
00:03:03,269 --> 00:03:07,290
by using the delete button he or she is

56
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:10,410
able to remove that item from the list

57
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:14,160
here okay so let's stop with

58
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:17,100
implementing the sample application step

59
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:21,989
by step and we will only use JavaScript

60
00:03:21,989 --> 00:03:25,500
and we will make no use of framework

61
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,829
like angular and react and UK has

62
00:03:28,829 --> 00:03:31,739
already set so let's start right away

63
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:35,970
I switch over to the terminal and let's

64
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:40,260
first get the project setup done and I

65
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:43,320
start by creating a new folder a new

66
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:50,010
project folder so make your J's app a

67
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:54,720
one okay let's change into that folder

68
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,600
and then we do need two files here and

69
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:03,180
so on we will keep things easy one file

70
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:09,989
is it's our HTML file index.html and the

71
00:04:09,989 --> 00:04:17,070
second file is main dot KS ok so here we

72
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:21,358
are ok so let's start on the source code

73
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:23,930
editor and in my case

74
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:35,120
on using Adam okay here we are so and

75
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,380
let's start with opening index.html and

76
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:43,220
start implementation and we will first

77
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:47,020
do a very basic implementation of

78
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,699
index.html so what do we need of course

79
00:04:49,699 --> 00:04:57,830
we need an HTML tag okay then we need a

80
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:01,430
head section we need a body section of

81
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:06,139
course and within the head section let's

82
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:09,169
just say that we want to have a meter

83
00:05:09,169 --> 00:05:12,850
element and we'll use that to put our

84
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:17,780
character set so cut care set equal to

85
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:25,550
the string UTF - 8 okay and we will use

86
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:30,849
the head section for defining a title

87
00:05:30,849 --> 00:05:34,370
okay let's name it

88
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:39,289
young script turn issue Karaka is the

89
00:05:39,289 --> 00:05:43,900
title of our application and okay let's

90
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:53,330
use a doctype of HTML and complete the

91
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:56,930
first implementation by including in the

92
00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:01,070
body section script text and with the

93
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:04,150
script tag we have the option of

94
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:10,789
including our our main GS file where the

95
00:06:10,789 --> 00:06:12,710
other script code of our application

96
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:20,419
goes into okay so main dot jf okay so

97
00:06:20,419 --> 00:06:23,060
the next step we need to take is to

98
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:25,699
include the bootstrap framework in our

99
00:06:25,699 --> 00:06:27,740
application and maybe you you saw it

100
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:32,870
from the user interface I showed you we

101
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:35,560
are using the bootstrap

102
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:39,800
CSS classes to include them as styling

103
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,980
in our application so it does not affect

104
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:47,810
our our implementation in playing the

105
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:49,810
other script it's only used for of

106
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:52,520
styling our user interface so that we

107
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:55,730
can concentrate on on implementing our

108
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:58,460
Yahoo script based web application and

109
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,710
the easiest way of including now the

110
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:06,350
bootstrap framework here is to go to get

111
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:09,910
bootstrap comms and here on the web side

112
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:12,440
you can see here is the button download

113
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,690
bootstrap let's let's click on that

114
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:19,610
button and here on that page you will

115
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:22,700
see an overview of various possibilities

116
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:25,520
of how to include bootstrap in your

117
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,830
project the easiest way is to just use

118
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:30,170
bootstrap from a content delivery

119
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:34,790
network so woods web CDN is affection we

120
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:39,380
um we are concentrating on and you can

121
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:41,390
see if we want to include it from a

122
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:43,100
content delivery network we need to

123
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,790
include the three things in our

124
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:48,140
application we need to include a link

125
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:51,610
element which points to the stylesheet

126
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:56,840
bootstrap mndot CS CSS and we need to

127
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,630
include another link element which

128
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:05,840
points to the bootstrap - a theme dot

129
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,350
MnDOT the CSS but this is optional this

130
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:13,510
is only needed if we want to use seaming

131
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:16,670
we do not want to use seaming in our

132
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:19,400
application so I do not need to include

133
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,440
the second thing you but I need to

134
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,670
institute the script element here that

135
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:27,410
is pointing to the RS code file of

136
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:30,610
bootstrap so let's do it let's first

137
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:31,990
[Music]

138
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:37,840
copy that link element and we will place

139
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:43,990
place a link element in rehab

140
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:50,820
here okay

141
00:08:52,529 --> 00:09:02,820
then take the script element copy it go

142
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:09,339
back to Adam and include it here in the

143
00:09:09,339 --> 00:09:17,320
body section okay okay the bootstrap

144
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:20,830
framework has one dependency and it

145
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:24,670
needs jQuery so we need to include

146
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:28,089
jQuery as well here in our project and

147
00:09:28,089 --> 00:09:31,779
again we are using it from a content

148
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:34,480
delivery network so let's switch over

149
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,620
and open another website and the website

150
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:42,130
we need is code dot J query comm and you

151
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:44,560
will find the jQuery core library here

152
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,339
and we would like to use version a three

153
00:09:48,339 --> 00:09:52,990
point X and the minified version so

154
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:54,730
let's click on it and you will get with

155
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:57,430
the script tag we need to include in our

156
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,500
application you will get it here and you

157
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,020
can simply copy it to the clipboard and

158
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:06,000
then switch back to Adam and include it

159
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:19,180
now let's include it here okay then

160
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:22,329
there is another dependency we do need

161
00:10:22,329 --> 00:10:25,810
and that is the small library which is

162
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:29,260
called chance Jas

163
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:32,050
the website is the Weibull at chance

164
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:35,680
jegs.com and that library will only use

165
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,310
it for one special task because we would

166
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:42,459
like to generate global unique

167
00:10:42,459 --> 00:10:44,980
identifiers for each of the issue

168
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:48,010
entries we are creating an our

169
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:51,160
application and creating global unique

170
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:51,700
event

171
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:54,340
first is something this library is

172
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:58,630
providing for us by simply using a

173
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:03,160
function put as you can see here and we

174
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,620
will use that function later on and now

175
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:07,960
we need to make sure that this library

176
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,150
is included and you will find that the

177
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:12,310
meaningful minified version here and if

178
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:16,660
I click on it we can take that URL here

179
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:24,000
and go back to Adam and include another

180
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:34,600
another script X with source set to that

181
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:39,100
URL ok so that's all what's needed to

182
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:42,790
hear I'll get early dependency which are

183
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:45,580
used and that is the core implementation

184
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:50,920
of index dot HTML ok next thing is to

185
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:54,130
bring some content here into our body

186
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:58,200
section and I do so by starting with

187
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,990
this section and the dis section we'll

188
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:04,030
get to find a class of container that

189
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:07,420
the bootstrap class of course and within

190
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:11,200
the big section let's start by adding a

191
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,850
heading and the heading should be J as

192
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:25,230
issue tracker and let's include small

193
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:40,560
small tag by coding smart way calm okay

194
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:45,280
so let's uncheck index dot HTML in the

195
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:49,090
browser and you can do so by switching

196
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:52,780
over to the command line and I'm using a

197
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:55,000
web server here and the web server the

198
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,600
development web server I'm you

199
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:02,630
is called life life server so that is

200
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:05,329
the command using that command I can

201
00:13:05,329 --> 00:13:08,019
start up the web server if you have not

202
00:13:08,019 --> 00:13:11,990
installed live server on your system you

203
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:14,569
can do so by simply installing it from

204
00:13:14,569 --> 00:13:20,810
bio npm just type in npm install - g for

205
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:22,819
installing it globally on your system

206
00:13:22,819 --> 00:13:25,329
and then use a package name live server

207
00:13:25,329 --> 00:13:28,250
so that would either command to install

208
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:30,860
it i have already installed live server

209
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:33,170
so i'm not going to execute this right

210
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:36,490
now instead I'm starting with serve up

211
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:40,730
okay and you can see it's automatically

212
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:43,069
loading on the website here on the

213
00:13:43,069 --> 00:13:45,050
browser so here you can see my headline

214
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:48,889
so let's see what's the advantage of

215
00:13:48,889 --> 00:13:52,130
using live server I will put it here as

216
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:56,149
side-by-side so live server as a name

217
00:13:56,149 --> 00:14:01,160
already promises is a development web

218
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,920
server with live reload capability so

219
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,110
what does it mean I can for example now

220
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:14,060
change something here my code face it

221
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:16,430
and you can see the web site was the

222
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:17,180
change

223
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:20,800
included with the changed output here is

224
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,920
reloaded immediate immediately I do not

225
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,620
need to reload it manually it's just

226
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:30,769
there so it's very easy to use it side

227
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:32,930
by side was my code editor I can see

228
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:37,660
immediately on what changes I am

229
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:40,160
implementing here in the code I can see

230
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,050
those changes reflected here in the

231
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:46,899
website okay so let's take that out so

232
00:14:46,899 --> 00:14:49,069
okay let's continue on the

233
00:14:49,069 --> 00:14:53,389
implementation just here under our

234
00:14:53,389 --> 00:14:57,740
headline we now want to include on the

235
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:00,500
HTML elements we do need for the form

236
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,970
and the input form should be embedded in

237
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:07,730
another dysfunction so what

238
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:14,290
in okay and we give it a class of

239
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:17,380
Jumbotron

240
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:20,540
okay that's again a bootstrap CSS class

241
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:24,260
and within that this section or let's

242
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:28,519
include another headline and let's give

243
00:15:28,519 --> 00:15:34,930
it a headline of add new issue and then

244
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:40,850
bring in the form element okay so we do

245
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:43,790
not need the action attribute here

246
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:47,089
instead we need to assign an ID and let

247
00:15:47,089 --> 00:15:54,170
it use the ID of issue input form okay

248
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:58,600
and within our form element we will use

249
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:02,170
three disk sections with a class form

250
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:08,350
- group assigned so let's bring them in

251
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:18,860
okay that's the first one class form -

252
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:23,990
group okay and for the first input

253
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:29,660
element let's use a label and the label

254
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:32,690
is for the input element which gets

255
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:37,750
assigned of the ID of issue description

256
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:41,680
input and we give it a label of

257
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:47,389
description okay next the input element

258
00:16:47,389 --> 00:16:50,029
and the input element for Ally

259
00:16:50,029 --> 00:16:51,980
description of course should be of type

260
00:16:51,980 --> 00:17:00,399
text we need a class of form control

261
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:05,170
okay then we need to assign VI d which

262
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:12,459
is issue discourage input okay and maybe

263
00:17:12,459 --> 00:17:15,220
like this one place over here and the

264
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:20,099
place over the text should be describe

265
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:28,000
the issue okay so that's the first

266
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,230
fungal now we can take a better section

267
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:37,530
here is the fungal section copy it one

268
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:41,170
two so that we have three deep sections

269
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:43,660
with class form this group assigned

270
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:47,610
included here in our form and now we

271
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:51,150
adapt the second this section here

272
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:55,480
that's the input section which should be

273
00:17:55,480 --> 00:18:01,030
used for let's see what do we need we do

274
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:06,390
need the similarity so let's give it the

275
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:13,170
label of severity and change the ID here

276
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:19,540
for which the label is for to issue the

277
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:26,590
rarity input okay and next we do need

278
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:30,560
the input element here that's text again

279
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,010
[Music]

280
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:34,990
no not in that case in that case we do

281
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:37,120
need to have something this one here so

282
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:42,970
we can remove it okay because we want to

283
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:45,970
have a selection list so that the user

284
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:49,480
can choose from the options low medium

285
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:52,720
and high and to implement such a

286
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,870
drop-down list we use the Select element

287
00:18:55,870 --> 00:19:03,310
and set and the Select element gets the

288
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:11,670
ID of issue severity input

289
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:16,040
and then within the Select element we do

290
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:19,940
need to include three times the option

291
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:23,830
element okay option

292
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:28,870
don't forget the end here so it's option

293
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:32,330
with the value of low that's the first

294
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:38,810
option and the description of low here

295
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:46,420
and last let's copy it okay then we have

296
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:52,940
medium with a label medium then we have

297
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:58,240
to value high with the list entry high

298
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:03,520
okay so here we are

299
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:08,330
whoo okay so we need to assign a class

300
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:13,480
here as well which is the class form

301
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:20,090
control once again so and you can see

302
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:23,450
here as we are typing in the HTML code

303
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:26,960
the output here here Nam in our browser

304
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,260
window updates automatically and we can

305
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:32,750
check right there that the drop-down

306
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:34,910
list for example is already implemented

307
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:38,270
correctly and showing the values low

308
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:40,880
medium and high we have specified here

309
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:45,200
and now we need to we need to adapt the

310
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,930
third section here the third form and

311
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:52,300
group and that's the input element for

312
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:59,930
the assigned to value so let's adapt the

313
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:09,050
label okay so that's again text we're

314
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:11,600
using the input element here we assign

315
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:15,500
the class form - control and the IDS

316
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:20,830
again issue assigned to input

317
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:22,640
placeholder let's check

318
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:34,910
- and possible okay so here we are let's

319
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:36,920
the form implemented you can see the

320
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,590
form is there it's embedded in a

321
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:42,950
Jumbotron that's indicated here at the

322
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:46,310
gray by the gray background color and

323
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:48,290
then we have the headline and we have

324
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:50,510
three input elements the description

325
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:52,850
which is of type text with the drop down

326
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:55,670
list for the severity value and we have

327
00:21:55,670 --> 00:21:59,420
again a text here for the side - okay so

328
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:03,310
one thing an our forum is as missing and

329
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:07,760
we do need to include a submit button at

330
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,340
the bottom of our form because we do

331
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:12,230
want to have a button away verses of the

332
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:15,590
user can click on the submit button and

333
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:20,750
add the new issue entry - to the list of

334
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:22,910
issues basically so let's include it

335
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:25,490
here on right before the closing form

336
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:31,900
text and we are using the button element

337
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:37,040
okay and the button element gets the

338
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,830
type which is submit in that case and it

339
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:44,240
gets assigned again class and we are

340
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,130
using actually two classes here we are

341
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:49,040
using the button class and the button -

342
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:53,540
primary class which gives us a result

343
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:57,020
the blue colored button from okay and

344
00:22:57,020 --> 00:23:00,680
let's say that the button should contain

345
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:04,790
a light LED okay here we are

346
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:08,150
that is the button and now we need to

347
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:12,920
include a few more things here right

348
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:17,920
under the this section of the Jumbotron

349
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:21,080
so one with continued implementation

350
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:27,290
here and let's card was implementing a

351
00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:30,530
new dissection and what this section

352
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:32,790
should be

353
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:41,430
of class called s - LG 12 so that we use

354
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:44,490
some all the 12 columns label on our

355
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:48,300
layout and within that we are defining

356
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:51,480
another dis section and we're using the

357
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:55,730
ID attribute to assign an ID of issues

358
00:23:55,730 --> 00:24:02,940
list here okay that's all for now that

359
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:07,050
this section will remain empty because

360
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:11,400
we do only want to use it later on in

361
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:14,010
our Yama script implementation when we

362
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:17,490
are iterating over the list of issues

363
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:21,630
and generating the HTML output we have

364
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:24,810
the possibility of retrieving that this

365
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:29,160
element here by retrieving it by using

366
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:32,610
that ID here issues list and then we are

367
00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:35,730
inserting the content the HTML content

368
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:39,210
here which is negative output all the

369
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:42,570
lists all the issues in our list of

370
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:45,840
issues and that HTML code will be

371
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,120
generated dynamically in our Yahoo

372
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:53,280
script code so that following later on

373
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:56,390
so let's include one more thing here

374
00:24:56,390 --> 00:25:01,080
let's define another discussion and this

375
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:04,020
time we are using a class of

376
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:09,110
footer and within the footer let's use a

377
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:15,030
paragraph element and then we say okay

378
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:22,470
copy coding this mod wacom save it and

379
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:25,800
you can see here is the result and yeah

380
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:28,100
that's that's all we need here in

381
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:31,560
index.html so far

382
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:34,230
next thing else to implement the llaves

383
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:37,380
code part of our application okay then

384
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:40,530
let's switch over to our second file in

385
00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:42,410
the project directory and that is

386
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:47,240
. jf and start implementation with a

387
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:54,550
function which is called fetch issues

388
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:59,810
and read function should be used to

389
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:03,950
fetch the list of issues already on a

390
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:07,490
Weibull and then as a data store and our

391
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:11,600
application I would like to use the

392
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:16,280
browser's local storage so that's the

393
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:19,100
place that is a storage location where

394
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:23,780
we will put issues which the user enters

395
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:26,960
by using the form and that's a place we

396
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:31,310
need to retrieve issues when the

397
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:35,000
application starts and as we do need to

398
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,270
retrieve issues as in various points in

399
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:40,910
time so for example after the

400
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:43,430
application has been loaded we will

401
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:45,560
implement the function which we can

402
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:49,970
later on call multiple times and that

403
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:52,220
function is called fresh issues and if

404
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:54,920
it supplies know where we put in the

405
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:59,960
implementation which is fetching issue

406
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:03,730
items from local storage and we start

407
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:07,090
with the program code so let's define

408
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:13,100
here a variable of the name issues and

409
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:17,080
that should be equal to the result of

410
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:22,400
Jason dot path and we are passing the

411
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:29,270
return value from local storage get item

412
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:32,690
and the item we would like to retrieve

413
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:35,210
from local storage is the item within

414
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:46,310
named issues okay next we will retrieve

415
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:49,060
reference

416
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:56,540
a reference to the dissection we

417
00:27:56,540 --> 00:28:00,840
declared in index dot HTML which helps

418
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,120
the ID of issues list aside and in the

419
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,150
other script we can do so by using

420
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:10,050
document in calling the function get

421
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:15,330
element by ID and then passing in the ID

422
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:19,140
of the disk section and legacy issues

423
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:20,120
list

424
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:26,520
okay so let's initialize the content and

425
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:31,590
make sure that the the content of that

426
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:36,570
div element is empty and we can set the

427
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:38,820
content by using a property which is

428
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:43,350
called in our HTML and we set it just an

429
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:51,059
empty string to make that sure okay okay

430
00:28:51,059 --> 00:28:52,950
now we need to bring in a loop and

431
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:57,090
iterate over the issue items which are

432
00:28:57,090 --> 00:29:02,429
in the issues object and for each of the

433
00:29:02,429 --> 00:29:08,910
issue item inside that array we need to

434
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:12,240
on generate the HTML code which is

435
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:17,760
needed to to produce the output we want

436
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:21,000
to have and that output needs to be

437
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,820
added to the inner HTML property of

438
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:27,929
issues worst and that's that's the way

439
00:29:27,929 --> 00:29:30,929
how we are generating the dynamic or is

440
00:29:30,929 --> 00:29:33,420
the output okay let's start

441
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:36,420
we're using a for loop and the for loop

442
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:39,240
is implemented by using for then we are

443
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:48,210
defining a variable e equals zero and

444
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:55,830
then we say he as less than

445
00:29:55,830 --> 00:30:10,510
issues class okay he plopped us okay and

446
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:13,930
within that loop we are retrieving the

447
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:18,300
various properties so let's define

448
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:25,530
variable ID and we are assigning issues

449
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:30,420
with index E and we are using the

450
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:34,780
property ID here then let's say

451
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:39,690
description should equal issues

452
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:49,120
description okaying next thing is the

453
00:30:49,120 --> 00:31:07,390
very key then we have assigned to take

454
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:14,650
the property and find two and finally we

455
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:22,050
are setting the status to issues index e

456
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:29,800
again and that status property okay okay

457
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:33,690
with all those variables label let's

458
00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:36,460
generate the HTML output for that

459
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:41,280
element and we will type that output to

460
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:47,700
issues list inner HTML and subscribed

461
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:54,760
okay and the first thing we need is this

462
00:31:54,760 --> 00:32:00,040
element and this element should get to

463
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:02,659
class well

464
00:32:02,659 --> 00:32:13,230
okay let's close it so the next thing we

465
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:16,260
do need is a headline and the headline

466
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:20,850
will be embedded in an h6 text and the

467
00:32:20,850 --> 00:32:25,470
headline is just printing out the he/she

468
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:31,440
ID okay and the issue ID of course is

469
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:44,159
available in ID okay so the next thing

470
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:50,130
is a paragraph and the paragraph should

471
00:32:50,130 --> 00:32:52,769
output of the status information and the

472
00:32:52,769 --> 00:32:57,690
status should be out put it by using a

473
00:32:57,690 --> 00:33:02,029
good strap label and we can do it by

474
00:33:02,029 --> 00:33:05,929
including a span element and assigning

475
00:33:05,929 --> 00:33:11,490
all the classes label and ylabel info to

476
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:15,919
point it out in a light blue color and

477
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:26,880
okay then use the status variables you

478
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:33,570
include the status and concatenate

479
00:33:33,570 --> 00:33:36,570
another string here with the

480
00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:45,320
corresponding closing HTML text okay

481
00:33:47,419 --> 00:33:53,970
okay next line is another headline close

482
00:33:53,970 --> 00:33:59,720
this time h3 and we are outputting the

483
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:11,489
description okay let's close it and then

484
00:34:11,489 --> 00:34:15,119
we need to output the severity

485
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:19,379
information let's do that by using

486
00:34:19,379 --> 00:34:22,710
another paragraph and we want to output

487
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:25,770
the sorority information by including an

488
00:34:25,770 --> 00:34:30,119
icon and bootstrap is providing a Nikon

489
00:34:30,119 --> 00:34:32,699
set and we can use that by again using

490
00:34:32,699 --> 00:34:36,918
the span element and give it a class of

491
00:34:36,918 --> 00:34:45,690
glyphs click on this icon like so and in

492
00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:47,760
that case we are using an icon which is

493
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:54,349
called glyphicon - type

494
00:34:54,710 --> 00:35:06,270
okay those are concatenated of the value

495
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:11,099
of the variable severity and finally

496
00:35:11,099 --> 00:35:21,310
let's close the paragraph okay

497
00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:25,400
and next thing is assigned to again we

498
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:28,609
would like to output it by using not

499
00:35:28,609 --> 00:35:31,280
only the assigned Q value but also an

500
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:34,460
icon it's the same thing so we can just

501
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:41,750
copy it from here okay the items of time

502
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:44,119
is not glyphicon - time it's called

503
00:35:44,119 --> 00:35:52,070
glyphicon - user pays value assigned to

504
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:57,760
and let's close the paragraph again

505
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:05,510
finally let's add two buttons for each

506
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:10,339
armed element and one button should be

507
00:36:10,339 --> 00:36:14,210
for setting the status to closed and the

508
00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:17,480
other button should be for deleting the

509
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:20,060
issue item from from the list and from

510
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:27,140
local start and we do that by using an a

511
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:32,900
element setting the HLF value to

512
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:39,130
compound and assign in class of from

513
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:44,270
button and button warning in the first

514
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:50,589
case here okay

515
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:55,910
so let it should be the close button and

516
00:36:55,910 --> 00:37:01,220
we are closing the element here the

517
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:04,000
second button

518
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:10,369
should be basically the same we are

519
00:37:10,369 --> 00:37:13,119
changing the class button warning to

520
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:18,440
button danger and we are renaming the

521
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:25,640
button with delete ok and now for both

522
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:29,000
buttons we need to attach an event

523
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,599
handler function to you the on click

524
00:37:32,599 --> 00:37:36,500
event and we do that by bringing in the

525
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:45,050
on click attribute and assigning the

526
00:37:45,050 --> 00:37:48,349
method call we want to have so in that

527
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:53,180
case for the close button we want to

528
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:58,040
call a function which is named set that

529
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:00,200
is closed of course we need to implement

530
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:05,150
that function later on and in the second

531
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:09,830
case here we want to call function which

532
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:14,869
is called delete issue and of course

533
00:38:14,869 --> 00:38:16,670
only calling the function without

534
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:19,190
passing any parameters is not sufficient

535
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:22,550
we need to pass in into that function or

536
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:26,119
the ID of the current element and we do

537
00:38:26,119 --> 00:38:33,220
that here by using the following

538
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:37,880
backslash quote because we need to

539
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:46,420
escape it here quote plus Rd and plus

540
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:51,800
quote X slash for the second quote again

541
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:57,109
and now we can take that spring copy it

542
00:38:57,109 --> 00:39:00,020
and insert it here and the call of the

543
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:04,900
delete issue function it as well ok now

544
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:07,820
one final string which needs to be

545
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:11,250
concatenated here and that's the closing

546
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:17,250
if element for the dish which has been

547
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:21,200
opened here at the beginning and that's

548
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,760
the last thing we need to concatenate

549
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:26,849
here and it's finally our string of HTML

550
00:39:26,849 --> 00:39:31,700
code we are generating for each item

551
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:36,570
okay so let's switch back to index dot

552
00:39:36,570 --> 00:39:40,170
HTML because now we want to make sure

553
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:43,050
that our function fetch issues is

554
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:47,970
executed one time when the application

555
00:39:47,970 --> 00:39:51,140
is loaded and we can achieve that by

556
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:56,940
including here in the body element and

557
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:59,250
attribute and event attribute which is

558
00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:04,410
called on load and assigning the call of

559
00:40:04,410 --> 00:40:08,220
the fetch issues function here and let

560
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:10,800
make sure that such issues is called

561
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:15,330
each time the application who loads at

562
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:17,400
the moment you can see nothing has

563
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:20,510
changed so far no output has been

564
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:23,670
generated no issues are added to the

565
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:27,300
output that's ok because we have not

566
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:30,770
added any issues to local storage yet so

567
00:40:30,770 --> 00:40:34,770
executing that function is retrieving

568
00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:37,740
zero results okay so next let's

569
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:39,990
implement on the source code which is

570
00:40:39,990 --> 00:40:43,770
needed to send data to local storage

571
00:40:43,770 --> 00:40:45,810
each time the user thought of the form

572
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:48,690
and click on add and we are switching

573
00:40:48,690 --> 00:40:53,700
over to main j/s and the first thing i'm

574
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:56,580
doing here is to add an event handler

575
00:40:56,580 --> 00:41:01,470
which handles on the submit event from

576
00:41:01,470 --> 00:41:04,020
our form and we can do so by saying

577
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:09,060
document dot get element by ID again and

578
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:12,270
i'm selecting the element we see rd

579
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:17,040
issue input form because that is the ID

580
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:20,880
of our form element and then I can say

581
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,640
dot add

582
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:30,930
event listener and want to respond to

583
00:41:30,930 --> 00:41:33,540
you or the submit event type as the

584
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:35,609
first parameter I need to pattern here

585
00:41:35,609 --> 00:41:39,089
and I'm attaching an event handler

586
00:41:39,089 --> 00:41:47,060
method which I call let's say save issue

587
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:51,740
okay so let's implement the save issue

588
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:57,050
function next and do that here

589
00:41:57,050 --> 00:42:03,690
save issue okay we are passing in a

590
00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:11,339
parameter of e that's the event and the

591
00:42:11,339 --> 00:42:14,190
first thing I'm doing I'm defining some

592
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:19,589
variables and designing the user input

593
00:42:19,589 --> 00:42:22,140
values to and the variables so let's

594
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:26,310
start the first thing I need is the

595
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:31,170
issue description and I want to have the

596
00:42:31,170 --> 00:42:33,660
well you need to user have type in into

597
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:35,670
the description field here in a memo

598
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:38,730
form and I can retrieve that value by

599
00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:45,530
saying document and get element by ID

600
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:49,530
passing in the ID of the input element

601
00:42:49,530 --> 00:42:55,579
that's in issue issue desk input and

602
00:42:55,579 --> 00:43:00,050
then I would like to have value the same

603
00:43:00,050 --> 00:43:08,810
for issue severity let's again say docu

604
00:43:08,810 --> 00:43:19,190
mount get element by ID

605
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:22,290
this time we want to have the element

606
00:43:22,290 --> 00:43:28,410
with CRD issue severity input and again

607
00:43:28,410 --> 00:43:43,890
the value next issue assigned to get

608
00:43:43,890 --> 00:43:49,300
element by ID and the ID is issue

609
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:50,660
[Music]

610
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:56,900
assigned to input okay

611
00:43:56,900 --> 00:44:04,230
the value okay that's basically what I

612
00:44:04,230 --> 00:44:06,210
need from my phone and then I need to

613
00:44:06,210 --> 00:44:12,120
two other things I do need mm identifier

614
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:17,400
for that issue let's say you are issue

615
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:21,390
Rd and now I'm using the chance to

616
00:44:21,390 --> 00:44:25,290
purchase library to generate a global

617
00:44:25,290 --> 00:44:28,700
unique identifier for that new ID and

618
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:31,830
using that library is very easy I only

619
00:44:31,830 --> 00:44:37,500
need to say chance but good and this

620
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:39,450
function is returning the global unique

621
00:44:39,450 --> 00:44:43,620
identifier and assigning that identifier

622
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:51,060
now here to my issue ID arrival okay

623
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:58,290
then I need to the status and I will set

624
00:44:58,290 --> 00:45:00,720
the status information to open because

625
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:06,660
open is the initial status okay okay now

626
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:09,120
we can put all those pieces of

627
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:11,010
information together and create a new

628
00:45:11,010 --> 00:45:14,220
issue of the object so let's say well

629
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:19,410
issue and then assign an object with

630
00:45:19,410 --> 00:45:29,000
properties of ID that OSU ID description

631
00:45:29,930 --> 00:45:35,849
that should be real description severity

632
00:45:35,849 --> 00:45:44,779
that should be issue severity okay I'm

633
00:45:44,779 --> 00:45:57,079
assigned to that should be issue sign to

634
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:06,000
status should be put to issue status

635
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:10,609
okay okay now that we have the issue

636
00:46:10,609 --> 00:46:14,569
object prepared we can continue

637
00:46:14,569 --> 00:46:17,069
inserting that object to local storage

638
00:46:17,069 --> 00:46:20,390
and we do that by first checking if

639
00:46:20,390 --> 00:46:23,940
there is already something in local

640
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:26,460
storage and we do that by using the

641
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:30,960
local storage and object here and using

642
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:36,619
the method get' item and we get item I I

643
00:46:36,619 --> 00:46:41,579
would leave the issue from a local

644
00:46:41,579 --> 00:46:43,920
storage object that the object oh we

645
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:46,950
would like to store all our issues come

646
00:46:46,950 --> 00:46:54,300
in and I check if this is now and if so

647
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:55,940
[Music]

648
00:46:55,940 --> 00:47:00,809
let's initialize an empty array which is

649
00:47:00,809 --> 00:47:09,569
called issues as well okay and then push

650
00:47:09,569 --> 00:47:14,339
into that array our issue object from

651
00:47:14,339 --> 00:47:18,329
above with all the properties filled

652
00:47:18,329 --> 00:47:21,210
with the corresponding values and now

653
00:47:21,210 --> 00:47:25,440
the array issues is containing exact one

654
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:27,450
element and now I can use the local

655
00:47:27,450 --> 00:47:32,609
storage again this time with set item

656
00:47:32,609 --> 00:47:35,770
and now I'm

657
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:39,640
setting issues with the key and I'm

658
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:45,180
setting that to the value to the Gaytan

659
00:47:45,180 --> 00:47:49,500
representation of let's see string

660
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:53,380
string is high here on all our issues

661
00:47:53,380 --> 00:47:57,910
array so the json dot stringify method

662
00:47:57,910 --> 00:48:01,960
takes that array and generates a json

663
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:04,960
object and that is the value we are

664
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:08,800
storing in to the issues issues object

665
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:12,930
and local storage that's the key okay

666
00:48:12,930 --> 00:48:19,920
okay now the L section and if we already

667
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:23,170
recognize that we have something in

668
00:48:23,170 --> 00:48:27,550
local storage we need to insert our new

669
00:48:27,550 --> 00:48:30,310
object and a slightly different way

670
00:48:30,310 --> 00:48:36,130
first we need to retrieve everything

671
00:48:36,130 --> 00:48:38,710
which is in local storage at the moment

672
00:48:38,710 --> 00:48:43,960
and assistant I'm using JSON parsing and

673
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:49,300
then requesting from local storage which

674
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:54,340
get item again the issues object and I'm

675
00:48:54,340 --> 00:48:56,920
getting it back in JSON format and then

676
00:48:56,920 --> 00:49:01,690
I use case and pass to generate again an

677
00:49:01,690 --> 00:49:05,980
array which I then assign two issues

678
00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:09,340
here now we have everything in the

679
00:49:09,340 --> 00:49:12,160
issues array which is a Weibull in local

680
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:16,600
storage and no again we can say issues

681
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:23,950
push issue or a new object so this is

682
00:49:23,950 --> 00:49:28,620
extending the array one more element is

683
00:49:28,620 --> 00:49:32,440
inserted and now I can send it back to

684
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:37,510
local storage so local storage again set

685
00:49:37,510 --> 00:49:43,290
item okay like so into the issues key

686
00:49:43,290 --> 00:49:46,120
and again I'm using JSON

687
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:47,250
[Music]

688
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:53,490
25 and passing in the issues array here

689
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:56,920
okay okay here we are that's basically

690
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:59,380
the code we need to insert our new issue

691
00:49:59,380 --> 00:50:03,330
object into our local start but um

692
00:50:03,330 --> 00:50:06,160
before finishing implementation of save

693
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:08,710
issue we need to do some final steps

694
00:50:08,710 --> 00:50:14,290
here first let's reset our input

695
00:50:14,290 --> 00:50:16,750
elements and we can use it very easily

696
00:50:16,750 --> 00:50:20,140
by saying document.getelementbyid d

697
00:50:20,140 --> 00:50:25,750
again I'm retrieving a reference to the

698
00:50:25,750 --> 00:50:28,090
form element by using the a D issue

699
00:50:28,090 --> 00:50:33,010
input form and then simply calling the

700
00:50:33,010 --> 00:50:35,650
reset method this makes sure that

701
00:50:35,650 --> 00:50:38,950
everything in the form is initialized

702
00:50:38,950 --> 00:50:45,730
and the values are removed next I'm once

703
00:50:45,730 --> 00:50:49,780
again calling fetch issues because now

704
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:52,150
with a new element inserted into local

705
00:50:52,150 --> 00:50:53,800
search we'll need to call such issues

706
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:57,600
again so that the list output is

707
00:50:57,600 --> 00:51:03,030
regenerated and the new element is

708
00:51:03,030 --> 00:51:06,160
included in the list output as well and

709
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:10,660
finally I need to say here E is at the

710
00:51:10,660 --> 00:51:13,270
event of the object and then call the

711
00:51:13,270 --> 00:51:19,950
method prevent default just to prevent

712
00:51:19,950 --> 00:51:25,870
default okay like so just to prevent the

713
00:51:25,870 --> 00:51:31,480
form from submitting so that's basically

714
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:36,610
all what's needed here in save issues so

715
00:51:36,610 --> 00:51:39,370
now let's check if everything is working

716
00:51:39,370 --> 00:51:43,780
as expected here in our application I am

717
00:51:43,780 --> 00:51:48,160
now using the form and type in the

718
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:49,780
information I need to create a new issue

719
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:51,830
so let's say

720
00:51:51,830 --> 00:51:57,380
or a function of X and I set it to

721
00:51:57,380 --> 00:52:01,340
medium and then I'm assigning myself and

722
00:52:01,340 --> 00:52:04,520
then click on button add and now you can

723
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:07,760
see as expected the most output is

724
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:11,210
generated on here you can see we have

725
00:52:11,210 --> 00:52:14,240
now one item on our list and it's output

726
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:19,370
in the way we wanted to on to show up

727
00:52:19,370 --> 00:52:22,730
here we have VRD we have the status

728
00:52:22,730 --> 00:52:25,160
information the description text the

729
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:29,900
severity the assigned to person and our

730
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:32,440
t buttons close and delete and of course

731
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:36,440
as we do not have implemented the event

732
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:40,280
handlers yet those buttons are not

733
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:43,160
working right now but that's the next

734
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:46,790
step and now to check once again that it

735
00:52:46,790 --> 00:52:49,250
is stored in the local search you can

736
00:52:49,250 --> 00:52:53,330
open up the developer tools here and go

737
00:52:53,330 --> 00:52:55,880
to the tab application and here you can

738
00:52:55,880 --> 00:53:00,320
see here is the possibility to take a

739
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:02,390
look into local storage for our

740
00:53:02,390 --> 00:53:04,760
application here running on port 8080

741
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:08,720
and you can see we have one object term

742
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:11,720
with key issues inserted here and that

743
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:16,370
object on have a value that's our with

744
00:53:16,370 --> 00:53:19,880
our ID and is containing all the values

745
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:26,210
belonging to our issue object okay so

746
00:53:26,210 --> 00:53:28,820
let's continue with implementing the

747
00:53:28,820 --> 00:53:31,760
missing pieces of our application and as

748
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:33,590
you might remember we have two more

749
00:53:33,590 --> 00:53:37,070
things to implement earlier we have

750
00:53:37,070 --> 00:53:40,370
defined here in our buttons to event

751
00:53:40,370 --> 00:53:44,030
handler functions set the status to

752
00:53:44,030 --> 00:53:46,990
closed for another close button and

753
00:53:46,990 --> 00:53:50,090
delete issue for other lip button of

754
00:53:50,090 --> 00:53:53,740
course and now we need to add both

755
00:53:53,740 --> 00:53:59,840
implementations to our file manager yes

756
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:05,540
and we start by implementing the event

757
00:54:05,540 --> 00:54:08,630
handler method set status to close so

758
00:54:08,630 --> 00:54:11,420
okay it's a function of course and it's

759
00:54:11,420 --> 00:54:16,670
called set that is closed and it needs

760
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:18,920
to take one parameter and that's the ID

761
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:22,750
of the issue item the user would like to

762
00:54:22,750 --> 00:54:29,120
delete okay so on the first thing we

763
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:32,620
need to do is again retrieve everything

764
00:54:32,620 --> 00:54:36,920
from local storage and put it into an

765
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:41,750
array which is called issues and again

766
00:54:41,750 --> 00:54:46,880
we are using JSON path and seen before

767
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:51,920
local starch get item and the item we

768
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:54,340
would like to get is called issues again

769
00:54:54,340 --> 00:54:58,730
okay next we need to iterate over all

770
00:54:58,730 --> 00:55:00,470
the elements we have retrieved from

771
00:55:00,470 --> 00:55:02,990
local storage which now inside that

772
00:55:02,990 --> 00:55:08,480
array and compare the ID of each of

773
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:12,290
those elements to the ID which is passed

774
00:55:12,290 --> 00:55:15,500
here into the method and if we have a

775
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:18,230
match between those IDs we know that is

776
00:55:18,230 --> 00:55:20,660
the object we want to delete so let's

777
00:55:20,660 --> 00:55:24,980
use the for loop here and let's say for

778
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:33,920
VAR e equals zero zero e less than shoes

779
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:40,960
length and the cluster okay

780
00:55:41,110 --> 00:55:48,130
so let's do the comparison if issues

781
00:55:49,360 --> 00:56:01,610
index e dot ID equals ID then we want to

782
00:56:01,610 --> 00:56:05,630
delete it and there know not to leave it

783
00:56:05,630 --> 00:56:08,480
on queue to set status to closed delete

784
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:10,400
will follow later on when we are

785
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:10,990
implement

786
00:56:10,990 --> 00:56:20,350
the issue method so let's put the status

787
00:56:20,350 --> 00:56:26,230
property to status closed okay that is

788
00:56:26,230 --> 00:56:30,430
what we want to have here and now as the

789
00:56:30,430 --> 00:56:33,790
change is made into the object which is

790
00:56:33,790 --> 00:56:36,640
here still on the array we can now write

791
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:40,800
it back to a local storage and again

792
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:46,060
using the method set item and writing it

793
00:56:46,060 --> 00:56:50,820
back to the issues key and using json

794
00:56:50,820 --> 00:56:57,460
stringify to convert that array to json

795
00:56:57,460 --> 00:57:01,570
format okay and finally don't forget to

796
00:57:01,570 --> 00:57:04,360
call fetch issues again because we would

797
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:07,780
like to update our output here so that's

798
00:57:07,780 --> 00:57:11,400
the implementation of set that is closed

799
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:16,480
okay so here we'll one typo that's

800
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:20,170
corrected and click fetch issue okay

801
00:57:20,170 --> 00:57:25,359
let's try it out now we can try to for

802
00:57:25,359 --> 00:57:29,170
that one item set the status from open

803
00:57:29,170 --> 00:57:30,880
to closed by using that button here so

804
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:32,920
let's click close and you can see it

805
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:35,859
immediately set to closed and it's

806
00:57:35,859 --> 00:57:38,170
updated with that new status information

807
00:57:38,170 --> 00:57:42,400
in local storage as well and as we call

808
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:44,440
federal issues here at the end of our

809
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:49,170
sets that is closed method the output is

810
00:57:49,170 --> 00:57:52,119
regenerated directly so that we can

811
00:57:52,119 --> 00:57:54,869
immediately see that the new status is

812
00:57:54,869 --> 00:57:59,200
available here in our user interface so

813
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:01,660
finally let's implement our second event

814
00:58:01,660 --> 00:58:05,500
handler and that's the function with a

815
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:06,580
name

816
00:58:06,580 --> 00:58:12,070
delete issue and again we need as a

817
00:58:12,070 --> 00:58:14,380
parameter the ID of the issue we would

818
00:58:14,380 --> 00:58:17,350
like to delete and for the

819
00:58:17,350 --> 00:58:22,900
implementation I will copy on pass the

820
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:23,450
code

821
00:58:23,450 --> 00:58:26,990
from the set that is closed event

822
00:58:26,990 --> 00:58:29,330
handler and now it's basically the same

823
00:58:29,330 --> 00:58:32,770
a first step is to retrieve everything

824
00:58:32,770 --> 00:58:35,750
for me local storage stored in the

825
00:58:35,750 --> 00:58:38,030
issues array and then iterate over all

826
00:58:38,030 --> 00:58:43,310
the array items and compare VIPs and if

827
00:58:43,310 --> 00:58:48,260
the ID is equal we know that we have

828
00:58:48,260 --> 00:58:51,230
found all the issue which needs to be

829
00:58:51,230 --> 00:58:54,230
deleted and now I only need to change

830
00:58:54,230 --> 00:58:57,680
that line of code here instead of

831
00:58:57,680 --> 00:58:59,870
setting the status information to close

832
00:58:59,870 --> 00:59:02,930
I need to do something different and I'm

833
00:59:02,930 --> 00:59:07,280
using the splice method to splice that

834
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:10,910
element out from bed array so it's index

835
00:59:10,910 --> 00:59:13,010
II and I want to splice out one element

836
00:59:13,010 --> 00:59:17,210
and so the element is removed from the

837
00:59:17,210 --> 00:59:20,120
array and then it's L ed so the same

838
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:22,460
here I can write it back to local

839
00:59:22,460 --> 00:59:26,720
storage and now with the element removed

840
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:29,960
and then call fetch issues again to

841
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:34,310
update the list output ok let's save it

842
00:59:34,310 --> 00:59:35,740
and now we can try it out

843
00:59:35,740 --> 00:59:40,340
now let's sir let's enter another issue

844
00:59:40,340 --> 00:59:46,570
here so now it's error in function a and

845
00:59:46,570 --> 00:59:52,550
now we are setting like to high play

846
00:59:52,550 --> 00:59:54,620
let's edit here you can see a second

847
00:59:54,620 --> 00:59:59,060
item in our list and I will now first

848
00:59:59,060 --> 01:00:02,030
set that item to clear loans to play

849
01:00:02,030 --> 01:00:03,710
again it's close and then I'm using

850
01:00:03,710 --> 01:00:09,380
delete to delete it here thank you very

851
01:00:09,380 --> 01:00:11,030
