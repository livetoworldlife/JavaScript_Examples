 ## HTTP CLIENT (Exercise 7 of 13)  
   
  Create a file named http-client.js.  
   
  Write a program that performs an HTTP GET request to a URL provided to you  
  as the first command-line argument. Write the String contents of each  
  "data" event from the response to a new line on the console (stdout).  
   
 ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────  
   
 ## HINTS  
   
  For this exercise you will need to use the http core module.  
   
  Documentation on the http module can be found by pointing your browser  
  here:  
  file:///usr/local/lib/node_modules/learnyounode/docs-nodejs/http.html  
   
  The http.get() method is a shortcut for simple GET requests, use it to  
  simplify your solution. The first argument to http.get() can be the URL  
  you want to GET; provide a callback as the second argument.  
   
  Unlike other callback functions, this one has the signature:  
   
     function callback (response) { / ... / }  
   
     Where the response object is a Node Stream object. You can treat Node  
     Streams as objects that emit events. The three events that are of most  
     interest are: "data", "error" and "end". You listen to an event like so:  
      
        response.on('data', function (data) { / ... / })  
      
     The "data" event is emitted when a chunk of data is available and can be  
     processed. The size of the chunk depends upon the underlying data source.  
      
     The response object / Stream that you get from http.get() also has a  
     setEncoding() method. If you call this method with "utf8", the "data"  
     events will emit Strings rather than the standard Node Buffer objects  
     which you have to explicitly convert to Strings.  
      
     Check to see if your program is correct by running this command:  
      
        $ learnyounode verify http-client.js

        program.js
